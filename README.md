# Dijkstra-Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm in computer science and graph theory, named after Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra. It is used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks, computer networks, or any other interconnected systems.
